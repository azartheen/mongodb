<p>Great to have you on board as a student!</p><p>This course also comes with free access to our <strong>Academind Community</strong> on Discord: <a href="https://academind.com/community/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/community/</a></p><p>There, you can find <strong>like-minded people</strong>, <strong>discuss</strong> issues, <strong>help each other</strong>, share progress, successes and ideas and simply have a good time!</p><p>I&nbsp;believe that you learn the most if you don't learn alone but find learning partners and other people with similar interests.
