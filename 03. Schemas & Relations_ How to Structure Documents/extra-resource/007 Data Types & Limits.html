<p>MongoDB has a couple of hard limits - most importantly, a single document in a collection (including all embedded documents it might have) must be &lt;=<strong>16mb</strong>. Additionally, you may only have <strong>100 levels of embedded documents</strong>.</p><p>You can find all limits (in great detail)here:<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/</a></p><p>For the data types, MongoDBsupports, you find a <strong>detailed overview</strong> on this page:<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/</a></p><p><strong>Important data type limits are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Normal integers (int32) can hold a maximum value of +-2,147,483,647</p></li><li><p>Long integers (int64) can hold a maximum value of +-9,223,372,036,854,775,807</p></li><li><p>Text can be as long as you want - the limit is the 16mb restriction for the overall document</p></li></ul><p>It's also important to understand the difference between int32 (NumberInt), int64 (NumberLong) and a normal number as you can enter it in the shell. The same goes for a normal double and NumberDecimal.</p><p><strong>NumberInt</strong> creates a <strong>int32</strong> value =&gt;<code>NumberInt(55)</code></p><p><strong>NumberLong</strong> creates a <strong>int64</strong> value =&gt;<code>NumberLong(7489729384792)</code></p><p>If you just use a number (e.g. <code>insertOne({a:1}</code>), this will get added as a <strong>normal double</strong> into the database. The reason for this is that the shell is based on JSwhich only knows float/double values and doesn't differ between integers and floats.</p><p><strong>NumberDecimal</strong> creates a high-precision double value =&gt;<code>NumberDecimal("12.99")</code> =&gt;This can be helpful for cases where you need (many) exact decimal places for calculations.</p><p>When not working with the shell but a MongoDBdriver for your app programming language (e.g. PHP, .NET, Node.js, ...), you can use the driver to create these specific numbers.</p><p>Example for Node.js:<a href="http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/Long.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/Long.html</a></p><p>This will allow you to build a NumberLong value like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const Long = require('mongodb').Long;

db.collection('wealth').insert( {
    value: Long.fromString("121949898291")
});</pre><p>By browsing the APIdocs for the driver you're using, you'll be able to identify the methods for building int32s, int64s etc.</p>
