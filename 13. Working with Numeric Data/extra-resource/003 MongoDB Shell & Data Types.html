<p>For this Module, there's one important thing you have to keep in mind about the MongoDBShell (which we're using via the mongo command): It is based on JavaScript, it's running on JavaScript.</p><p>Hence you can use JavaScript syntax in there and hence the default data types are the default JavaScript data types.</p><p>That matters especially for the numbers. JavaScript does NOT differentiate between integers and floating point numbers =&gt;Every number is a 64bit float instead.</p><p>So 12 and 12.0 are exactly the same number in JavaScript and therefore also in the Shell.</p>
