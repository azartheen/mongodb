<p>What does <code>createIndex()</code> do in detail?</p><p>Whilst we can't really see the index, you can think of the index as a simple list of values + pointers to the original document.</p><p>Something like this (for the "age"field):</p><p><code>(29, "address in memory/ collection a1")</code></p><p><code>(30, "address in memory/ collection a2")</code></p><p><code>(33, "address in memory/ collection a3")</code></p><p>The documents in the collection would be at the "addresses" <code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code> and <code>a3</code>. The order does not have to match the order in the index (and most likely, it indeed won't).</p><p>The important thing is that the index items are <strong>ordered</strong> (ascending or descending - depending on how you created the index). <code>createIndex({age: 1})</code> creates an index with <strong>ascending sorting</strong>, <code>createIndex({age:-1})</code>creates one with <strong>descending</strong> <strong>sorting</strong>.</p><p>MongoDBis now able to quickly find a fitting document when you filter for its age as it has a sorted list. Sorted lists are way quicker to search because you can skip entire ranges (and don't have to look at every single document).</p><p>Additionally, sorting (via <code>sort(...)</code>) will also be sped up because you already have a sorted list. Of course this is only true when sorting for the age.</p><p><br></p>
